# Release notes for cobrapy 0.11.0

## New features

* Add an argument `processes` to the functions `find_essential_genes` and
  `find_essential_reactions`.
* Automatic documentation generation should hopefully mean that it's never
  out-of-date.

## Backwards incompatible changes
<!--more-->

* Homogenize all function and class arguments using multiprocessing to accept an
  integer for `processes`. This affects functions from deletion and sampling
  code.
