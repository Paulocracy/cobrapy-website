# Release notes for cobrapy 0.10.1

## Fixes

* `pandas` has dropped support for Python 3.4 and we are doing the same for our
  automated tests. If you are running Python 3.4 and have a working installation
  of numpy and pandas, adding cobrapy on top of that is no problem.
* Updated some URLs in the links.
