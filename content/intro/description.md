COBRA methods are widely used for genome-scale modeling of metabolic
networks in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. **cobrapy** is a
constraint-based modeling package that is designed to accommodate the
biological complexity of the next generation of COBRA models and
provides access to commonly used COBRA methods, such as flux balance
analysis, flux variability analysis, and gene deletion analyses.
