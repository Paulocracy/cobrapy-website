**cobrapy** is a python package that provides a simple interface to metabolic constraint-based reconstruction and analysis. The package includes simple, object-oriented interfaces for model construction (including reading to/from sbml, matlab, and json formats) and implements commonly used COBRA methods such as flux balance analysis, flux variability analysis, and gene deletion analyses. **cobrapy** is a community-supported effort under active development.
