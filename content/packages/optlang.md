Optlang is a Python package for solving mathematical optimization
problems, i.e. maximizing or minimizing an objective function over a
set of variables subject to a number of constraints. Optlang provides
a common interface to a series of optimization tools, so different
solver backends can be changed in a transparent way. Optlang's
object-oriented API takes advantage of the symbolic math library
[sympy](http://sympy.org/en/index.html) to allow objective functions
and constraints to be easily formulated from symbolic expressions of
variables
