MICOM is a Python package for metabolic modeling of microbial communities
and is developed in the Human Systems Biology Group at the INMEGEN, Mexico
abd Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, USA.

MICOM allows you to construct a community model from a list on input COBRA
models and manages exchange fluxes between individuals and individuals with the
environment. It explicitly accounts for different abundances of individuals in
the community and can thus incorporate data from 16S amplicon sequencing or metagenomic
shotgun experiments.
