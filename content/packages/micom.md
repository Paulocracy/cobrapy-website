[MICOM](https://doi.org/10.1101/361907) is a Python package for metabolic modeling of microbial communities
and is developed in the Human Systems Biology Group at the INMEGEN, Mexico
abd Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, USA.

MICOM allows you to construct a community model from a list on input COBRA
models and manages exchange fluxes between individuals and individuals with the
environment. It explicitly accounts for different abundances of individuals in
the community and the tradeoff between individual and community-wide
biomass production. MICOM can incorporate incorporate data from 16S amplicon
sequencing or metagenomic shotgun experiments.
