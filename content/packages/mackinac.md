Mackinac combines the ability of [ModelSEED](http://modelseed.org) to
automatically reconstruct metabolic models with the advanced analysis
capabilities in cobrapy to bridge the differences between the two
frameworks. Mackinac provides support for using the ModelSEED web
service to create draft genome-scale models from genomes available in
the
[Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC)](https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Home>)
and creates a COBRA model from a ModelSEED model.
