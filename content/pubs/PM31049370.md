This article contains further data and information from our published manuscript [1]. We aim to identify significant transcriptome alterations of total normal human thyroid vs. histologically normal thyroid adjacent to papillary thyroid carcinoma. We performed a systematic meta-analysis of all the available gene expression profiles for the whole organ also collecting gene expression data for the normal thyroid adjacent to papillary thyroid carcinoma. A differential quantitative transcriptome reference map was generated by using TRAM (Transcriptome Mapper) software able to combine, normalize and integrate a total of 35 datasets from total normal thyroid and 40 datasets from histologically normal thyroid adjacent to papillary thyroid carcinoma from different sources. This analysis identified genes and genome segments that significantly discriminated the two groups of samples. Differentially expressed genes were grouped and enrichment function analyses were performed identifying the main features of the differentially expressed genes between total normal thyroid and histologically normal thyroid adjacent to papillary thyroid carcinoma. The search for housekeeping genes retrieved 414 loci.
