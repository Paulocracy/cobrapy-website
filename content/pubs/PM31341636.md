Heterosis, or hybrid vigour, is said to occur when F1 individuals exhibit increased performance for a number of traits compared to their parental lines. Improved traits can include increased size, better yield, faster development and a higher tolerance to pathogens or adverse conditions. The molecular basis for the phenomenon remains disputed, despite many decades of theorising and experimentation. In this study, we add a genetics layer to a constraint-based model of plant (
