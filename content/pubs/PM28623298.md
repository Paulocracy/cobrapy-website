Acinetobacter baumannii is a clinical threat to human health, causing major infection outbreaks worldwide. As new drugs against Gram-negative bacteria do not seem to be forthcoming, and due to the microbial capability of acquiring multi-resistance, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic targets. Here we have derived a list of new potential targets by means of metabolic reconstruction and modelling of A. baumannii ATCC 19606. By integrating constraint-based modelling with gene expression data, we simulated microbial growth in normal and stressful conditions (i.e. following antibiotic exposure). This allowed us to describe the metabolic reprogramming that occurs in this bacterium when treated with colistin (the currently adopted last-line treatment) and identify a set of genes that are primary targets for developing new drugs against A. baumannii, including colistin-resistant strains. It can be anticipated that the metabolic model presented herein will represent a solid and reliable resource for the future treatment of A. baumannii infections.
