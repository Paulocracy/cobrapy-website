Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a widely-used method for analyzing metabolic networks. However, most existing tools that implement FBA require downloading software and writing code. Furthermore, FBA generates predictions for metabolic networks with thousands of components, so meaningful changes in FBA solutions can be difficult to identify. These challenges make it difficult for beginners to learn how FBA works.
