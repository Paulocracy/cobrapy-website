C4 photosynthesis is a key domain of plant research with outcomes ranging from crop quality improvement, biofuel production and efficient use of water and nutrients. A metabolic network model of C4 "lab organism" Setaria viridis with extensive gene-reaction associations can accelerate target identification for desired metabolic manipulations and thereafter in vivo validation. Moreover, metabolic reconstructions have also been shown to be a significant tool to investigate fundamental metabolic traits.
