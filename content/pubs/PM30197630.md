The abundance of methane in shale gas and of other gases such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide as chemical process byproducts has motivated the use of gas fermentation for bioproduction. Recent advances in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology allow for engineering of microbes metabolizing a variety of chemicals including gaseous feeds into a number of biorenewables and transportation liquid fuels. New computational tools enable the systematic exploration of all feasible conversion alternatives. Here we computationally assessed all thermodynamically feasible ways of co-utilizing CH
