Key aspects of leaf mitochondrial metabolism in the light remain unresolved. For example, there is debate about the relative importance of exporting reducing equivalents from mitochondria for the peroxisomal steps of photorespiration versus oxidation of NADH to generate ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we address this and explore energetic coupling between organelles in the light using a diel flux balance analysis model. The model included more than 600 reactions of central metabolism with full stoichiometric accounting of energy production and consumption. Different scenarios of energy availability (light intensity) and demand (source leaf versus a growing leaf) were considered, and the model was constrained by the nonlinear relationship between light and CO
