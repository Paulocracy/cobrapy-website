Microbes in ecosystems often develop coordinated metabolic interactions. Therefore, understanding metabolic interdependencies between microbes is critical to deciphering ecosystem function. In this study, we sought to deconstruct metabolic interdependencies in organohalide-respiring consortium ACT-3 containing Dehalobacter restrictus using a combination of metabolic modeling and experimental validation. D. restrictus possesses a complete set of genes for amino acid biosynthesis yet when grown in isolation requires amino acid supplementation. We reconciled this discrepancy using flux balance analysis considering cofactor availability, enzyme promiscuity, and shared protein expression patterns for several D. restrictus strains. Experimentally,
