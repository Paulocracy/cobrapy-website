Methylocystis parvus is a type II methanotroph characterized by its high specific methane degradation rate (compared to other methanotrophs of the same family) and its ability to accumulate up to 50% of its biomass in the form of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) under nitrogen limiting conditions. This makes it a very promising cell factory.
