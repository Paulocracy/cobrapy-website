Phytophthora infestans is a plant pathogen that causes an important plant disease known as late blight in potato plants (Solanum tuberosum) and several other solanaceous hosts. This disease is the main factor affecting potato crop production worldwide. In spite of the importance of the disease, the molecular mechanisms underlying the compatibility between the pathogen and its hosts are still unknown.
