A great deal of research over the last several years has focused on how the inherent randomness in movements and reactivity of biomolecules can give rise to unexpected large-scale differences in the behavior of otherwise identical cells. Our own research has approached this problem from two vantage points - a microscopic kinetic view of the individual molecules (nucleic acids, proteins, etc.) diffusing and interacting in a crowded cellular environment; and a broader systems-level view of how enzyme variability can give rise to well-defined metabolic phenotypes. The former led to the development of the Lattice Microbes software - a GPU-accelerated stochastic simulator for reaction-diffusion processes in models of whole cells; the latter to the development of a method we call population flux balance analysis (FBA). The first part of this article reviews the Lattice Microbes methodology, and two recent technical advances that extend the capabilities of Lattice Microbes to enable simulations of larger organisms and colonies. The second part of this article focuses on our recent population FBA study of Escherichia coli, which predicted variability in the usage of different metabolic pathways resulting from heterogeneity in protein expression. Finally, we discuss exciting early work using a new hybrid methodology that integrates FBA with spatially resolved kinetic simulations to study how cells compete and cooperate within dense colonies and consortia.
