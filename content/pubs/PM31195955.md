Detection of central nodes in asymmetrically directed biological networks depends on centrality metrics quantifying individual nodes' importance in a network. In topological analyses on metabolic networks, various centrality metrics have been mostly applied to metabolite-centric graphs. However, centrality metrics including those not depending on high connections are largely unexplored for directed reaction-centric graphs.
